# RuleNameGen

If you're familiar with some of my projects like Nocturna, The Starlight Rebellion, or Gloamwardens, this is essentially the rule-based name generator from those projects, ported to Python.

## Features

This tool allows you to load rulesets, stored as JSON files, and returns a list of names generated according to the defined rules. An example ruleset is provided, so you can copy the format of that to create your own rulesets.

## Usage

This tool requires `pipenv` and `make`.

To run the tool, simply use `make run`.
